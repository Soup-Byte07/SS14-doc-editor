[color=#aaaaaa]▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬[/color]
Now for the moment you've all been waiting for, where I actually teach you how to do some [italic]real bureaucracy.[/italic]

[head=3]BEFORE THE PEN EVEN COMES OUT[/head]  [color=#e5e5e5]███████████[/color]
Before you pull your pen out of whatever sad dark hole you store it in, you need to think about [italic]what[/italic] you're writing.
[bold]The main things you need to consider are[/bold]
 > Are you filling a template? Writing a letter? Etc.
 > The purpose of this document/form/letter
 > Who is it for
 > Who is going to interact with it
    Which heads should be privy, if any?
 > What information is [italic]important[/italic]
    You must strike a balance between including too little
    information to be useful, and including so much that
    nobody is going to have the time to read/fill the thing.
 > What should be the demeanor/spirit of the page.
    There's a big difference between a legal document, and an
    invitation to a birthday party. Your tone and formatting
    must reflect that.

[bold]Things that every document should strive to be.[/bold]
[bold] > Readable.[/bold]
    Consistent formatting helps here, as does grammar and
    spelling. But also knowing when to break up large texts.
[bold] > Concise, not condensed.[/bold]
    Don't overcomplicate, don't reiterate too many times.
    Don't make something so long that nobody cares. [italic](Tom
    himself could learn to internalize this bit)[/italic] But don't make
    something so DENSE that nobody can understand.
[bold] > Professional.[/bold]
    In some circumstances this one can be ignored. But it must
    be a concious decision to do so, formal is default. Please do
    not talk like a child in your fax to CentCom. You can get the
    whole station fired. You don't need to speak like a lawyer
    though. You just need to act mature. Like an adult.

[head=3]STRUCTURE YOUR THOUGHTS[/head]  [color=#e5e5e5]████████████████[/color]
Most documents have a few main parts:
 > Header, include basic important info like name or topic
 > Body, this is where paragraphs go
 > Footer, usually just something like "signed, NAME"

And the Body can often have parts of its own:
 > Introduction/background, introduce the reader to the doc
 > Action item, the meat/potatoes, maybe a request or a
    declaration or something. Usually the whole REASON you
    are writing, goes here.
 > Context/reasoning, you might put a reason for the action
    item here. Some sort of explanation or additional info.

Of course, not all documents/letters are or should or have to be structured this way. You can structure them exactly how you want, but they should have [bold]some kind of structure[/bold], and that is the main point of this section.

[head=3]BASIC FORMATTING & YOU[/head]  [color=#e5e5e5]██████████████████[/color]
Formatting is important for looking professional. It's also the most fun part of writing if you think of yourself as a creative person. Volume 3 covers extended formatting, here we will simply cover basic formatting.

Tags are the way that you create bold or italicized text.
        \[bold][bold]Like this![/bold]\[/bold]

Tags follow basic rules in their construction, they are always surrounded by brackets and they are ended using "/" at the beginning of the tag you want to end. They can also be escaped with "\\"[I had to escape the slash with a second one I dont know why] which is useful if you need them to be visible in the text (like above).
[bold]An up to date list of tags and their use can be found in the "writing" section of the guidebook.[/bold]

Important tags include:
 > \[head=#], creates headers on a size between 1 and 3.
    (1 being the biggest)
 > \[bold], self-explanatory
 > \[italic], self-explanatory
 > \[bolditalic], does both
 > \[bullet/], makes a bullet point. Though, > or - looks just as
    good or better, and is fewer characters.
 > \[color=#], takes either names like "blue", "red" or hex
    codes like "#ff2222", "#AAAAAA", etc.

[head=3]Tips![/head]
 > Header can be used for more than just headers,
    be creative! Try new things!
 > Big headers can end up intruding on the line above them,
    and will get cut off if they are in the first line of the
    document, so make sure to give them space
 > You can use multiple tags on the same text, such as an
    italic header or a blue bullet point
 > Try not to use colors that are hard to read, and make sure
    not to overdo it. Your document should not look like clown
    vomit. (unless you're going for that)
 > If you see something very impressive you can open it with
    your pen to see how it is put together, unless it is stamped
    in which case it cannot be edited. (DONT STEAL THOUGH)
 > [bold]Never eat any taco bell left-overs that are 4 days old
    or older.[/bold]
