Hello! Welcome to Tom's Guide to Bureaucracy. Get your coffee, dry-cleaned suits, and clicky pens ready because we're going to learn how to be a cromulent bureaucrat in a station environment. If you read this guide and really internalize it, you just might find yourself in the green suit of a CentCom official some day!

[head=3]TOOLS OF A BUREAUCRAT[/head]  [color=#e5e5e5]███████████████████[/color]
There are some tools that every bureaucrat will need. And some others that are not strictly required, but help.
[bold]REQUIRED TOOLS:[/bold]
 > Pen, the fancier the better
 > Folders, for staying organized
 > Paper, for writing on
 > Fax machine, for sending & receiving TPS reports

[bold]RECOMMENDED TOOLS:[/bold]
 > Stamps, approved & denied atleast, ideally your role too
 > Niccotine, many HoPs take up smoking to stay focused
    during a busy work-day
 > A fancy suit and shoes
 > A briefcase, for the bureaucrat on the move
 > Multiple pens, never know when you need a backup
 > Filing cabinets, for when folders aren't enough

As a bureaucrat, paper is your one and only true love. Got a wife or husband? Not anymore, now you have paper. Paper is your significant other, and writing is your way of showing love and affection. The most important things you do:
 > Keep up with quarterly reports from NT
 > Manage your (modest) stock portfolio
 > Write
 > Complete TPS forms
 > Receive fax
 > Write
 > Send fax
 > Write

In all seriousness though, there are going to be times when the station does genuinely have use of you. When someone needs a permit for something, or some sort of legal document. Or hell, maybe [italic]you're[/italic] a lawyer! What an efficient profession double-whammy.

When this happens, you will figure out what the ideal template for the situation is, and fill it out, or have your client fill it out and offer assistance when needed. Maybe there isn't an applicable template, that's fine. Make one.

It's important to remember that there's no template for every single possible situation, and sometimes you will have to do something every bureaucrat fears; [italic]having an original thought![/italic] But for fucks sake don't panic. Just re-light the half-cigarette you put out earlier, inhale the stale niccotine, and flex your writing muscles (primarily your brain and wrist).

Anywhere there isn't a template, there are small ones in disguise. That doesn't make sense? What I mean is, don't worry too much about formatting. Just get the words on the page, and then grab some formatting pieces from the document parts pages you printed out earlier.

You didn't print them? What the hell are you doing, you're supposed to be competent, not some washed-up has-been bureaucrat! Get your head in the game, and more importantly get your document signed and stamped!

Before you get something stamped, make sure it's [bold]done[/bold]. Like, really done. Once it is stamped, you can't (usually) edit it again! Alright, it's stamped and done now. Congrats, you actually did your job instead of getting drunk and passing out next to Ian's bed again.

If that doesn't give you the sense that this is not a life worth pursuing, I don't know what will.

Where we will learn all about putting the pen to the page.
Note that I said PEN not TEARS.
