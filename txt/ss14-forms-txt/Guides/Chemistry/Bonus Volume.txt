[head=2]Bonus Volume: Topicals & Defense Chemicals[/head]
[color=#aaaaaa]▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬[/color]
Hello! This volume contains some information that wouldn't fit in the other three, but that I wanted to write down anyway because I think it's useful information. We'll cover how to make topicals (basic and advanced) and we'll cover some more chemicals that [italic]are not medicine[/italic].

[head=3]BASIC TOPICALS[/head]  [color=#e5e5e5]████████████████████████████[/color]
Topicals are not medicines that reference recent events. Topical medicines are medicines that are applied to the surface of a body, I.E. "on top". Bandages, ointment, sutures, and regenerative mesh are examples of topical treatments.

Topicals are trivial to apply, as there is no way to fuck it up. They do not have interactions with other medicines, and they do not have overdoses.

[head=3]DEFENSE CHEMICALS[/head]  [color=#e5e5e5]███████████████████████[/color]
Occasionally as a chemist you may be called upon to defend your station. As such, you are permitted to produce poisons, pyrotechnics, narcotics, etc. during these scenarios. [bold]This is a responsibility that you must take seriously. You will bring a great shame upon the name of The Chemist if you abuse your powers and your responsibility.[/bold]

[bold]This section has different notation from other volumes[/bold]
[color=#000000]██ POISON NAME | DAMAGE DEALT | AMOUNT/UNIT[/color]

[color=#BF8C00]██ SULFURIC ACID | CAUSTIC | 1.666[/color]
[50 oxyg + 25 hydr + 25 sulfur] x2

[color=#9e6b38]██ FLUOROSURFACTANT | FOAM | NA[/color]
When this chemical reacts with water it will create a foam that takes all chemicals in solution with it, allowing for things like airborne poisons.
[40(2) carb + 40(2) fluo + 20(1) sulfuric acid] x2

[color=#D6CE7B]██ AMATOXIN | POISON | 15[/color]
Grind fly amanita for 25, 8 required for 200u

[color=#b3cfcb]██ RAZORIUM | SLASH | 3[/color]
Mix any 2 Bic-based Brute meds

[color=#5C6274]██ LEAD | POISON | 20[/color]
Incredibly slow, but VERY deadly. 10u is enough to kill someone, but it will take awhile.

[color=#EFB8B8]██ CHLORINE TRIFLUORIDE | EXPLOSIVE | NA[/color]
[75(3) fluo + 25(1) chlo] x2
explodes when heated above 370k
