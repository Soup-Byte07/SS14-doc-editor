I further affirm and understand that I am personally responsible for all requisitioned items. I recognize that there are certain inherent risks associated with the above requisitions, and I assume full responsibility for injury to myself and my coworkers, and further release and discharge Nanotrasen for injury, loss, or damage arising out of my use of the powered exosuit, whether caused by the fault of my self, my coworkers, or other third parties.

I agree to indemnify and defend Nanotrasen against all claims, causes of action, damages, judgements, costs, or expenses, including attourney fees and other litigation costs, which may in any way arise from my use of the powered exosuit.

I agree to pay all fees caused by any negligent, reckless, or willful actions by myself or any third party.

I acknowledge I am under no pressure or duress to sign this Agreement and that I have been given a reasonable opprotunity to review it before signing. I futher agree and acknowledge that I free to have my own legal counsel review this Agreement if I so desire.

This Agreement and each of its terms are the product of an arm's length negotiation between the Parties. In the event of any ambiguity is found to exist in the interpretation of this Agreement, or any of its provisions, the Parties, and each of them, explicitly reject the application of any legal or equitable rule of interpretation which would lead to a construction of either "For" or "Against" a particular party based upon their status as the drafter of a specific term, language, or provision giving rise to such ambiguity.

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement, whether standing alone or as applied to a particular occurrence or circumstance, shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement or of any other applications of such provision, as the case may be, and such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed not to be a part of this Agreement.
