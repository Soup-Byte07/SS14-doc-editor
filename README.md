# SS14 DOC Editor

This project is for the <del>MRP fans</del> Paperwork pushers out there. No longer do you have torture your GPU just to write
a silly form. <del>Of course this isn't just for MRP.</del> This can be used on any SS14 (Space Station 14) Server, as long as it supports
the BBCode Style language.

## LIVE DEMO AGHHHH!!!

[try it out here!](https://soup-byte07.github.io/SS14-doc-editor/)

## How does it work?

Easy! We use the same syntax styling that Space Station 14 uses and just simply output that result.

If you want head titles then it would be something like this:

``
[head=1]Hello, World![/head]
``

of course it can go from 1 to 6.

Want to change the color?
``
[color=red]Hello, World![/color]
``

Supports hex and named colors.

Here are available tags:

``
[bold]Hello, World[/bold]
``

``
[italic]Hello, World[/italic]
``

``
[bolditalic]Hewwo, World[/bolditalic]
``

``
[bullet/] teheehee
``

## How do I run this project?

First Git Clone the project:

`git clone https://github.com/Soup-Byte07/SS14-doc-editor.git`

Once you cloned the project, simply change your directory into the project folder,
and run this command to install all the dependencies.

`npm install`

And now run this command to start up the project.

`npm run dev`

You should now see a funny thing that looks like this

```

  VITE vF.U.N  ready in 322 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

```

Thats it! Just simply head to http://localhost:5173/ and you should see it.

If for some reason you want to update it, just simply run

`npm update`
