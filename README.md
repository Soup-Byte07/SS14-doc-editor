# SS14 DOC Editor

![ss14-doc-editor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e80d4c9-ef6d-4440-af4d-9e0f441683a2)


This project is for the MRP fans out there. No longer do you have torture your GPU just to write
a silly form. Of course this isn't just for MRP. This can be used on any SS14 (Space Station 14) Server, as long as it supports
the doc language.

(This project isn't finished yet!)

## LIVE DEMO AGHHHH!!!

[try it out here!](https://soup-byte07.github.io/SS14-doc-editor/)

## How does it work?

Easy! We use the same syntax styling that Space Station 14 uses and just simply output that result.

For Example

``
I feel [bold]like[/bold] im 4 different people at once
``

## Guide?

Coming soon...
