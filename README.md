# SS14 DOC Editor

This project is for the MRP fans out there. No longer do you have torture your GPU just to write
a silly form. Of course this isn't just for MRP. This can be used on any SS14 (Space Station 14) Server, as long as it supports
the doc language.

## How does it work?

Easy! We use the same syntax styling that Space Station 14 uses and just simply output that result.

For Example

``SS14
I feel [bold]like[/bold] im 4 different people at once
```


```
